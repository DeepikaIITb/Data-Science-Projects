This is all about making life easy to identify the personality as extrovert or introvert.
This can help you identify your pluses and minuses to be the extrovert or introvert may be.

**Personality Classification: Extrovert vs. Introvert**
This project explores a machine learning pipeline to classify individuals as Extroverts or Introverts based on their social behavior traits. The dataset used contains behavioral indicators like time spent alone, frequency of social events, stage fear, and social media usage.
The project demonstrates key steps in a data science workflowâ€”from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing to model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
Dataset 
1. Rows: 2,900
2. Columns: 8 behavioral features + 1 target label (Personality)
Features include:
1. Time_spent_Alone
2. Stage_fear
3. Social_event_attendance
4. Going_outside
5. Drained_after_socializing
6. Friends_circle_size
7. Post_frequency
8. Personality (Target: Introvert/Extrovert)
Techniques Used
1. Data Cleaning and Imputation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
3. Label Encoding and Feature Scaling
Supervised Learning Models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV for Logistic Regression)
Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
Project Goal: To predict personality type based on social behaviors and compare different classification algorithms. This project can be extended to applications in psychology, marketing, and behavioral modeling.
Run the notebook: Personality_Classification.ipynb
Future Work
1. Add more models (e.g., SVM, Gradient Boosting)
2. Try feature selection and dimensionality reduction
3. Deploy as a web app (e.g., with Streamlit)
